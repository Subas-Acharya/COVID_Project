Despite the global efforts to mitigate ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the disease transmission and the effective controls still remain uncertain as the outcome of the epidemic varies from place to place. In this regard, the province-wise data from Nepal provides a unique opportunity to study the effective control strategies because (a) some provinces of Nepal share open-border with India resulting in a significantly high inflow of COVID-19 cases from India; (b) despite the inflow of a considerable number of cases, the local spread was quite controlled until mid June of 2020, presumably due to control policies implemented; and (c) the relaxation of policies caused rapid surge of the COVID-19 cases, providing a multi-phasic trend of disease dynamics. In this study, we used this unique data set to explore the inter-provincial disparity of the important indicators, such as epidemic trend, epidemic growth rate, and reproduction numbers. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to identify prevention and control policies that are effective on altering these indicators. Our analysis identified a noticeable inter-province variation in the epidemic trend (3 per day to 104 per day linear increase during third surge period), the median daily growth rate (1 to 3\% per day exponential growth), the basic reproduction number (1.03 to 1.19), and the effective reproduction number (maximum values ranging from 1.20 to 3.55). Importantly, results from our modeling show that the type and number of control strategies that are effective on altering the indicators vary among provinces, and thus underscore the need of province-focused strategies along with the national-level strategy in order to assure the control of local spread.

## There are 8 datasets included here. One for the country (Nepal) and the rest for each of the 7 provinces.

*Dataset descriptions:

There are 7 columns in nepal dataset. 
1. Date
2. nepal_test: It contains the number of tests done on the day.
3. nepal_isolation: It is the number of isolations on the day.
4. nepal_quar: It is the number of qurantines on the day.
5. nepal_reported_cases: It is the number of reported cases on the day.
6. nepal_recovered_cases: It is the number of recovered cases on the day.
7. nepal_death_cases: It is the number of death cases on the day.

Similarly, all the provincewise datasets contain the same columns, just name indicated by the corresponding province.
